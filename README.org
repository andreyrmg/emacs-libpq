An Emacs 25 module for accessing postgres via libpq.

It doesn't expose many libpq features yet, but what's there should be
crash-safe no matter what you do in the lisp world.  I've been using
it half a year now for reading mail through my Gnus backend [[https://github.com/anse1/nnpg][nnpg]]
without incidents.

See [[./test.el]] for implemented functions and examples how to use it.

If you make it crash, please report.

Note that =pq= silently converts bigints and numerics your queries
return to lisp floats because they don't fit into a lisp integer.
This looses precision on big values.  If you need the full precision,
cast them to =text= and use, e.g., =calc-eval= to do arbitrary
precision things with them.
